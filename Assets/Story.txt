One day two prgrammers were very bored. Let's call them Alfred and Lucy. They had invented a time machine.

Alfred showed Lucy something on his hands.

She said, "What is that?"


Lucy raised her voice, "Ok. Gee, I get it. Relax."

She was curious too about it. She wrapped her hands around the object. She felt every pin, egde and corner.

Alfred was right. The thing was magnificent.


On their when, computing components had gotten so small that you couldn't really appreciate the craft that went into making those things. How every transistor was soldered into the circuitry, every pin perfectly placed in the right spot to make a brain that could add faster than any living creature in the Universe. A network of neurons sending messages to each other. A whole __world__ could be programmed with one of those things. A world with matter, stars and life. A Universe.

Alfred said, "You think it still works?"


Lucy gave him a smile, "Only one way to find out."


"Tim." She said.

Tim was the name of the time machine which had been integrated into their Computer.


"Earth. Sunnyvale, California. November, 1970."


"Instructing Quantum Core With Coordinates. Just a moment..."


"What are you doing?" Alfred said.

"I'm going to leave a gift to somebody."

Alfred was dumbfounded. He honestly had no idea what she had in mind.


"Ready to energize at your command." Tim said.

She couldn't stop smiling, "Energize."

They were both beamed back to November, 1970.

A few minutes later(few minutes as in when traveling at lightspeed), they were beamed back to their time. Lucy was elated to go through the Archives, Alfred not so much.

That was a miliion-times more CPU power than the computers that were on Apollo. Alfred hoped that that thing wasn't used to start WWW3 or something. Even if the CPU wasn't working, that still is too much knowledge for humans at the time.

They found the archive of that timeline and compared it to a timeline where there was no such advanced CPU.


The Archive showed them what was different between the two timelines:


"Really?"Lucy sounded dissapointed.

"Thank goodnes, they were just able to make particles a little earlier in time."


He noticed Lucy was compltely bummed out, "What were you expecting?"


"Something more I guess. But it is what it is. Wanna play?"

They spent the entire afternoon playing FirePong.
