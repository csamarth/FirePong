# FirePong

## ToDo

- [x] Setup VCS
  - Master branch has base game (empty) (also rules - only stable changes)
  - Every feature will have separate branch
  - Features can only be merged and require at least 2 approvals

**In case just pulling this project on your local doesn't work, try following the guide given [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/workflow/project_setup/version_control_systems.html) under *Official Git Plugin*. If you're on a windows then do checkout the last paragraph on that page under *Working with Git on Windows* cause line endings are annoying**
